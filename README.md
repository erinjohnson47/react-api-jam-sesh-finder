### The Group
This project was painstakenly and tirelessly worked on by Jeremy Yandell and Erin Johnson.  Erin was the github manager and drafted the readme file.  Jeremy and Erin mostly created this app using pair programming with a driver/navigator format where one person typed while the other directed.  During this process the pair communicated well with each other to solve challenging problems despite different ways of learning and troubleshooting.
